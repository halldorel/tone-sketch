Tone.js sketching
===
Note: Still very much WIP.

This repo is for quickly setting up and running a basic local development environment for working with Tone.js.

	yarn install
	yarn new

`yarn new` is still to be properly implemented, needs a step where a setup template is copied. Do this by hand now, but then run:

	yarn serve
